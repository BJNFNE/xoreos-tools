.SH NAME
xml2tlk - XML to BioWare TLK converter
.SH SYNOPSIS
xml2tlk [<options>] [<input file>] <output file>
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B xml2tlk
converts XML files created by the tlk2xml tool back into the
BioWare TLK format. For a more in-depth description of TLK
files, please see the man page for the tlk2xml tool. Also note
that currently, only the non-GFF versions, V3.0 and V4.0, can be
created by xml2tlk.
.PP
The format of the input XML is pretty simple and straight-forward.
.IP "" 4
.nf
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" standalone="yes"?>
<tlk language="0">
  <string id="1">Continue</string>
  <string id="2" sound="hello">Well hello there!</string>
  <string id="3" sound="bye" soundlength="0.5">Bye!</string>
  <string id="4" soundid="23">Who are you?</string>
</tlk>
.fi
.PP
The root element is "tlk", and it can have an optional language
property. That language ID can also be given on the command line,
and it then overrides the one in the input XML. When creating a,
versions V3.0 and V4.0 need a language ID, while versions V0.2
and V0.5 ignore the language ID.
.PP
Each child tag of the root element has to be a "string" element,
and each "string" element requires an "id" property. The ID is
the string reference (StrRef) for the text line, and the contents
of the "string" element is the text itself. The whole file has to
be UTF-8 encoded.
.PP
Version V3.0 allows the following extra properties on a "string":
"sound" (a resource reference of a voice-over for this line, <=
16 characters), "soundlength" (a floating point number denoting
the length of the sound file in seconds), "volumevariance" (unused
by the games) and "pitchvariance" (unused by the games).
.PP
Version V4.0 allows the extra property "soundid" on a "string",
which is a numerical references to a voice-over line.
.PP
Versions V0.2 and V0.5 do not allow any extra properties.
.PP
Because TLK files contain localized string data, it is important
to know the encoding of those strings. Unfortunately, the TLK
files do not contain information about the encoding. Version 3.0
and 4.0 contain a language identifier, but the meaning of that
varies between games. V0.2 and V0.5 even lack those completely.
However, due to the Huffman-nature of V0.5 strings, the encoding
there is fixed to little-endian UTF-16, and strings in V0.2 files
are also usually in little-endian UTF-16 (with the exceptions of
files found in the Nintendo DS game
.IR "Sonic Chronicles: The Dark Brotherhood" ")."
To manually select the encoding, this tool provides a wide range
command line options for various encodings.
.PP
Alternatively, the game this TLK is from can be specified and
xml2tlk will write the strings in an appropriate encoding for that
game and the language ID. Please note that this does not work for
the game
.IR "Sonic Chronicles: The Dark Brotherhood" ,
since its TLK files do not provide a language ID.
